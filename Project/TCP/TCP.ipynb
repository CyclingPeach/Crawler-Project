      "1.1.  Motivation\n",
      "\n",
      "  Computer communication systems are playing an increasingly important\n",
      "  role in military, government, and civilian environments.  This\n",
      "  document focuses its attention primarily on military computer\n",
      "  communication requirements, especially robustness in the presence of\n",
      "  communication unreliability and availability in the presence of\n",
      "  congestion, but many of these problems are found in the civilian and\n",
      "  government sector as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As strategic and tactical computer communication networks are\n",
      "  developed and deployed, it is essential to provide means of\n",
      "  interconnecting them and to provide standard interprocess\n",
      "  communication protocols which can support a broad range of\n",
      "  applications.  In anticipation of the need for such standards, the\n",
      "  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has\n",
      "  declared the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) described herein to\n",
      "  be a basis for DoD-wide inter-process communication protocol\n",
      "  standardization.\n",
      "\n",
      "  TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to\n",
      "  fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network\n",
      "  applications.  The TCP provides for reliable inter-process\n",
      "  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to\n",
      "  distinct but interconnected computer communication networks.  Very few\n",
      "  assumptions are made as to the reliability of the communication\n",
      "  protocols below the TCP layer.  TCP assumes it can obtain a simple,\n",
      "  potentially unreliable datagram service from the lower level\n",
      "  protocols.  In principle, the TCP should be able to operate above a\n",

      "  The interface between an application process and the TCP is\n",
      "  illustrated in reasonable detail.  This interface consists of a set of\n",
      "  calls much like the calls an operating system provides to an\n",
      "  application process for manipulating files.  For example, there are\n",
      "  calls to open and close connections and to send and receive data on\n",

      "  asynchronously communicate with application programs.  Although\n",
      "  considerable freedom is permitted to TCP implementors to design\n",
      "  interfaces which are appropriate to a particular operating system\n",
      "  environment, a minimum functionality is required at the TCP/user\n",
      "  interface for any valid implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The interface between TCP and lower level protocol is essentially\n",
      "  unspecified except that it is assumed there is a mechanism whereby the\n",
      "  two levels can asynchronously pass information to each other.\n",
      "  Typically, one expects the lower level protocol to specify this\n",

      "\n",
      "  The internetwork environment consists of hosts connected to networks\n",
      "  which are in turn interconnected via gateways.  It is assumed here\n",
      "  that the networks may be either local networks (e.g., the ETHERNET) or\n",
      "  large networks (e.g., the ARPANET), but in any case are based on\n",
      "  packet switching technology.  The active agents that produce and\n",
      "  consume messages are processes.  Various levels of protocols in the\n",
      "  networks, the gateways, and the hosts support an interprocess\n",
      "  communication system that provides two-way data flow on logical\n",
      "  connections between process ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The term packet is used generically here to mean the data of one\n",
      "  transaction between a host and its network.  The format of data blocks\n",
      "  exchanged within the a network will generally not be of concern to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hosts are computers attached to a network, and from the communication\n",
      "  network's point of view, are the sources and destinations of packets.\n",
      "  Processes are viewed as the active elements in host computers (in\n",
      "  accordance with the fairly common definition of a process as a program\n",
      "  in execution).  Even terminals and files or other I/O devices are\n",
      "  viewed as communicating with each other through the use of processes.\n",
      "  Thus, all communication is viewed as inter-process communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Since a process may need to distinguish among several communication\n",
      "  streams between itself and another process (or processes), we imagine\n",
      "  that each process may have a number of ports through which it\n",

      "  Processes transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of\n",
      "  data as arguments.  The TCP packages the data from these buffers into\n",

      "  ensure reliable ordered data transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The model of internet communication is that there is an internet\n",

      "  to the local network.  This internet module packages TCP segments\n",
      "  inside internet datagrams and routes these datagrams to a destination\n",
      "  internet module or intermediate gateway.  To transmit the datagram\n",

      "  from its local packet and examined to determine through which network\n",
      "  the internet datagram should travel next.  The internet datagram is\n",

      "  A gateway is permitted to break up an internet datagram into smaller\n",
      "  internet datagram fragments if this is necessary for transmission\n",
      "  through the next network.  To do this, the gateway produces a set of\n",
      "  internet datagrams; each carrying a fragment.  Fragments may be\n",
      "  further broken into smaller fragments at subsequent gateways.  The\n",
      "  internet datagram fragment format is designed so that the destination\n",

      "The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is intended for use as a highly\n",
      "reliable host-to-host protocol between hosts in packet-switched computer\n",
      "communication networks, and in interconnected systems of such networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This document describes the functions to be performed by the\n",
      "Transmission Control Protocol, the program that implements it, and its\n",
      "interface to programs or users that require its services.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.  Motivation\n",
      "\n",
      "  Computer communication systems are playing an increasingly important\n",
      "  role in military, government, and civilian environments.  This\n",
      "  document focuses its attention primarily on military computer\n",
      "  communication requirements, especially robustness in the presence of\n",
      "  communication unreliability and availability in the presence of\n",
      "  congestion, but many of these problems are found in the civilian and\n",
      "  government sector as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As strategic and tactical computer communication networks are\n",
      "  developed and deployed, it is essential to provide means of\n",
      "  interconnecting them and to provide standard interprocess\n",
      "  communication protocols which can support a broad range of\n",
      "  applications.  In anticipation of the need for such standards, the\n",
      "  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has\n",
      "  declared the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) described herein to\n",
      "  be a basis for DoD-wide inter-process communication protocol\n",
      "  standardization.\n",
      "\n",
      "  TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to\n",
      "  fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network\n",
      "  applications.  The TCP provides for reliable inter-process\n",
      "  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to\n",
      "  distinct but interconnected computer communication networks.  Very few\n",
      "  assumptions are made as to the reliability of the communication\n",
      "  protocols below the TCP layer.  TCP assumes it can obtain a simple,\n",
      "  potentially unreliable datagram service from the lower level\n",
      "  protocols.  In principle, the TCP should be able to operate above a\n",
      "  wide spectrum of communication systems ranging from hard-wired\n",
      "  connections to packet-switched or circuit-switched networks.\n",

      "2.1.  Elements of the Internetwork System\n",
      "\n",
      "  The internetwork environment consists of hosts connected to networks\n",
      "  which are in turn interconnected via gateways.  It is assumed here\n",
      "  that the networks may be either local networks (e.g., the ETHERNET) or\n",
      "  large networks (e.g., the ARPANET), but in any case are based on\n",
      "  packet switching technology.  The active agents that produce and\n",
      "  consume messages are processes.  Various levels of protocols in the\n",
      "  networks, the gateways, and the hosts support an interprocess\n",
      "  communication system that provides two-way data flow on logical\n",
      "  connections between process ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The term packet is used generically here to mean the data of one\n",
      "  transaction between a host and its network.  The format of data blocks\n",
      "  exchanged within the a network will generally not be of concern to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hosts are computers attached to a network, and from the communication\n",
      "  network's point of view, are the sources and destinations of packets.\n",
      "  Processes are viewed as the active elements in host computers (in\n",
      "  accordance with the fairly common definition of a process as a program\n",
      "  in execution).  Even terminals and files or other I/O devices are\n",
      "  viewed as communicating with each other through the use of processes.\n",
      "  Thus, all communication is viewed as inter-process communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Since a process may need to distinguish among several communication\n",
      "  streams between itself and another process (or processes), we imagine\n",
      "  that each process may have a number of ports through which it\n",
      "  communicates with the ports of other processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.  Model of Operation\n",
      "\n",
      "  Processes transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of\n",
      "  data as arguments.  The TCP packages the data from these buffers into\n",
      "  segments and calls on the internet module to transmit each segment to\n",
      "  the destination TCP.  The receiving TCP places the data from a segment\n",
      "  into the receiving user's buffer and notifies the receiving user.  The\n",
      "  TCPs include control information in the segments which they use to\n",
      "  ensure reliable ordered data transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The model of internet communication is that there is an internet\n",
      "  protocol module associated with each TCP which provides an interface\n",
      "  to the local network.  This internet module packages TCP segments\n",
      "  inside internet datagrams and routes these datagrams to a destination\n",
      "  internet module or intermediate gateway.  To transmit the datagram\n",
      "  through the local network, it is embedded in a local network packet.\n",
      "\n",

      "  destination internet module.\n",
      "\n",
      "  At a gateway between networks, the internet datagram is \"unwrapped\"\n",
      "  from its local packet and examined to determine through which network\n",
      "  the internet datagram should travel next.  The internet datagram is\n",
      "  then \"wrapped\" in a local packet suitable to the next network and\n",
      "  routed to the next gateway, or to the final destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A gateway is permitted to break up an internet datagram into smaller\n",
      "  internet datagram fragments if this is necessary for transmission\n",
      "  through the next network.  To do this, the gateway produces a set of\n",
      "  internet datagrams; each carrying a fragment.  Fragments may be\n",
      "  further broken into smaller fragments at subsequent gateways.  The\n",
      "  internet datagram fragment format is designed so that the destination\n",
      "  internet module can reassemble fragments into internet datagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A destination internet module unwraps the segment from the datagram\n",
      "  (after reassembling the datagram, if necessary) and passes it to the\n",
      "  destination TCP.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This simple model of the operation glosses over many details.  One\n",
      "  important feature is the type of service.  This provides information\n",
      "  to the gateway (or internet module) to guide it in selecting the\n",
      "  service parameters to be used in traversing the next network.\n",
      "  Included in the type of service information is the precedence of the\n",
      "  datagram.  Datagrams may also carry security information to permit\n",
      "  host and gateways that operate in multilevel secure environments to\n",
      "  properly segregate datagrams for security considerations.\n",

      "\n",
      "  The TCP is assumed to be a module in an operating system.  The users\n",
      "  access the TCP much like they would access the file system.  The TCP\n",
      "  may call on other operating system functions, for example, to manage\n",
      "  data structures.  The actual interface to the network is assumed to be\n",
      "  controlled by a device driver module.  The TCP does not call on the\n",
      "  network device driver directly, but rather calls on the internet\n",
      "  datagram protocol module which may in turn call on the device driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The mechanisms of TCP do not preclude implementation of the TCP in a\n",
      "  front-end processor.  However, in such an implementation, a\n",
      "  host-to-front-end protocol must provide the functionality to support\n",

      "  within a segment is that the first data octet immediately following\n",
      "  the header is the lowest numbered, and the following octets are\n",
      "  numbered consecutively.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is essential to remember that the actual sequence number space is\n",
      "  finite, though very large.  This space ranges from 0 to 2**32 - 1.\n",
      "  Since the space is finite, all arithmetic dealing with sequence\n",
      "  numbers must be performed modulo 2**32.  This unsigned arithmetic\n",
      "  preserves the relationship of sequence numbers as they cycle from\n",
      "  2**32 - 1 to 0 again.  There are some subtleties to computer modulo\n",

      "\n",
      "  Computer communication systems are playing an increasingly important\n",

      "  document focuses its attention primarily on military computer\n",
      "  communication requirements, especially robustness in the presence of\n",
      "  communication unreliability and availability in the presence of\n",
      "  congestion, but many of these problems are found in the civilian and\n",
      "  government sector as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As strategic and tactical computer communication networks are\n",
      "  developed and deployed, it is essential to provide means of\n",
      "  interconnecting them and to provide standard interprocess\n",
      "  communication protocols which can support a broad range of\n",
      "  applications.  In anticipation of the need for such standards, the\n",
      "  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has\n",
      "  declared the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) described herein to\n",
      "  be a basis for DoD-wide inter-process communication protocol\n",

      "  TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to\n",

      "  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to\n",

      "\n",
      "  The internetwork environment consists of hosts connected to networks\n",
      "  which are in turn interconnected via gateways.  It is assumed here\n",
      "  that the networks may be either local networks (e.g., the ETHERNET) or\n",
      "  large networks (e.g., the ARPANET), but in any case are based on\n",
      "  packet switching technology.  The active agents that produce and\n",
      "  consume messages are processes.  Various levels of protocols in the\n",
      "  networks, the gateways, and the hosts support an interprocess\n",
      "  communication system that provides two-way data flow on logical\n",
      "  connections between process ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The term packet is used generically here to mean the data of one\n",
      "  transaction between a host and its network.  The format of data blocks\n",
      "  exchanged within the a network will generally not be of concern to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hosts are computers attached to a network, and from the communication\n",
      "  network's point of view, are the sources and destinations of packets.\n",
      "  Processes are viewed as the active elements in host computers (in\n",
      "  accordance with the fairly common definition of a process as a program\n",
      "  in execution).  Even terminals and files or other I/O devices are\n",
      "  viewed as communicating with each other through the use of processes.\n",
      "  Thus, all communication is viewed as inter-process communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Since a process may need to distinguish among several communication\n",
      "  streams between itself and another process (or processes), we imagine\n",
      "  that each process may have a number of ports through which it\n",

      "2.2.  Model of Operation\n",
      "\n",
      "  Processes transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of\n",
      "  data as arguments.  The TCP packages the data from these buffers into\n",
      "  segments and calls on the internet module to transmit each segment to\n",
      "  the destination TCP.  The receiving TCP places the data from a segment\n",
      "  into the receiving user's buffer and notifies the receiving user.  The\n",
      "  TCPs include control information in the segments which they use to\n",
      "  ensure reliable ordered data transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The model of internet communication is that there is an internet\n",
      "  protocol module associated with each TCP which provides an interface\n",
      "  to the local network.  This internet module packages TCP segments\n",
      "  inside internet datagrams and routes these datagrams to a destination\n",
      "  internet module or intermediate gateway.  To transmit the datagram\n",
      "  through the local network, it is embedded in a local network packet.\n",

      "  internet datagram fragments if this is necessary for transmission\n",
      "  through the next network.  To do this, the gateway produces a set of\n",
      "  internet datagrams; each carrying a fragment.  Fragments may be\n",
      "  further broken into smaller fragments at subsequent gateways.  The\n",

      "1.1.  Motivation\n",
      "\n",
      "  Computer communication systems are playing an increasingly important\n",
      "  role in military, government, and civilian environments.  This\n",
      "  document focuses its attention primarily on military computer\n",
      "  communication requirements, especially robustness in the presence of\n",
      "  communication unreliability and availability in the presence of\n",
      "  congestion, but many of these problems are found in the civilian and\n",
      "  government sector as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As strategic and tactical computer communication networks are\n",
      "  developed and deployed, it is essential to provide means of\n",
      "  interconnecting them and to provide standard interprocess\n",
      "  communication protocols which can support a broad range of\n",
      "  applications.  In anticipation of the need for such standards, the\n",
      "  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has\n",
      "  declared the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) described herein to\n",
      "  be a basis for DoD-wide inter-process communication protocol\n",
      "  standardization.\n",
      "\n",
      "  TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to\n",
      "  fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network\n",
      "  applications.  The TCP provides for reliable inter-process\n",
      "  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to\n",

      "  potentially unreliable datagram service from the lower level\n",

      "1.4.  Interfaces\n",
      "\n",
      "  The TCP interfaces on one side to user or application processes and on\n",
      "  the other side to a lower level protocol such as Internet Protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The interface between an application process and the TCP is\n",
      "  illustrated in reasonable detail.  This interface consists of a set of\n",
      "  calls much like the calls an operating system provides to an\n",
      "  application process for manipulating files.  For example, there are\n",
      "  calls to open and close connections and to send and receive data on\n",
      "  established connections.  It is also expected that the TCP can\n",
      "  asynchronously communicate with application programs.  Although\n",
      "  considerable freedom is permitted to TCP implementors to design\n",
      "  interfaces which are appropriate to a particular operating system\n",
      "  environment, a minimum functionality is required at the TCP/user\n",
      "  interface for any valid implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The interface between TCP and lower level protocol is essentially\n",
      "  unspecified except that it is assumed there is a mechanism whereby the\n",
      "  two levels can asynchronously pass information to each other.\n",
      "  Typically, one expects the lower level protocol to specify this\n",
      "  interface.  TCP is designed to work in a very general environment of\n",
      "  interconnected networks.  The lower level protocol which is assumed\n",
      "  throughout this document is the Internet Protocol [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "1.5.  Operation\n",
      "\n",
      "  As noted above, the primary purpose of the TCP is to provide reliable,\n",
      "  securable logical circuit or connection service between pairs of\n",
      "  processes.  To provide this service on top of a less reliable internet\n",

      "\n",
      "    The TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets in each\n",
      "    direction between its users by packaging some number of octets into\n",
      "    segments for transmission through the internet system.  In general,\n",
      "    the TCPs decide when to block and forward data at their own\n",
      "    convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Sometimes users need to be sure that all the data they have\n",
      "    submitted to the TCP has been transmitted.  For this purpose a push\n",
      "    function is defined.  To assure that data submitted to a TCP is\n",
      "    actually transmitted the sending user indicates that it should be\n",
      "    pushed through to the receiving user.  A push causes the TCPs to\n",
      "    promptly forward and deliver data up to that point to the receiver.\n",
      "    The exact push point might not be visible to the receiving user and\n",
      "    the push function does not supply a record boundary marker.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Reliability:\n",
      "\n",
      "    The TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or\n",
      "    delivered out of order by the internet communication system.  This\n",
      "    is achieved by assigning a sequence number to each octet\n",
      "    transmitted, and requiring a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the\n",
      "    receiving TCP.  If the ACK is not received within a timeout\n",
      "    interval, the data is retransmitted.  At the receiver, the sequence\n",
      "    numbers are used to correctly order segments that may be received\n",
      "    out of order and to eliminate duplicates.  Damage is handled by\n",
      "    adding a checksum to each segment transmitted, checking it at the\n",
      "    receiver, and discarding damaged segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "    As long as the TCPs continue to function properly and the internet\n",
      "    system does not become completely partitioned, no transmission\n",
      "    errors will affect the correct delivery of data.  TCP recovers from\n",
      "    internet communication system errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Flow Control:\n",
      "\n",
      "    TCP provides a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data\n",
      "    sent by the sender.  This is achieved by returning a \"window\" with\n",
      "    every ACK indicating a range of acceptable sequence numbers beyond\n",
      "    the last segment successfully received.  The window indicates an\n",

      "  that the networks may be either local networks (e.g., the ETHERNET) or\n",
      "  large networks (e.g., the ARPANET), but in any case are based on\n",
      "  packet switching technology.  The active agents that produce and\n",
      "  consume messages are processes.  Various levels of protocols in the\n",
      "  networks, the gateways, and the hosts support an interprocess\n",
      "  communication system that provides two-way data flow on logical\n",
      "  connections between process ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The term packet is used generically here to mean the data of one\n",
      "  transaction between a host and its network.  The format of data blocks\n",
      "  exchanged within the a network will generally not be of concern to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hosts are computers attached to a network, and from the communication\n",
      "  network's point of view, are the sources and destinations of packets.\n",
      "  Processes are viewed as the active elements in host computers (in\n",
      "  accordance with the fairly common definition of a process as a program\n",
      "  in execution).  Even terminals and files or other I/O devices are\n",
      "  viewed as communicating with each other through the use of processes.\n",
      "  Thus, all communication is viewed as inter-process communication.\n",

      "  streams between itself and another process (or processes), we imagine\n",
